# Terraria-Optimization
The base code used in my Terraria Optimizations Mod. While the code does function in its current state, if you know anything about coding, feel free to look through this code. This was my first venture into modding someone else's game so I'm sure there's things that could've been done better. 

UPDATED TO WORK WITH TMODLOADER 1.4.4

How to use the mod for those new to Terraria modding:
1. Open TModLoader
2. On The Main Screen click "Workshop"
3. Click "Develop Mods"
4. In the bottom right, click "Create Mod"
5. In the "ModName" field type "GoatOptimizations" (this is just what it's called within my code. if you know what you're doing, feel free to change the name. just please credit me in some way.)
6.In the "Mod DisplayName" field, you can type whatever you want the mods name to show up as in your mod list
7. In the "Mod Author" field, put your username
8. In the bottom right, click "Create"
9. You can use whatever program you prefer to open the file. For those that don't code and just want to use the base codeive provided, you can just use a text document.
10. In the file that opens up (Should be called "GoatOptimizations.cs) copy & paste the entire code that I have provided.
11. Make sure to save the file
12. Back in TModLoader, find where "GoatOptimizations" is on the "Mod Sources" screen. Click "Build + Reload"

Now the mod should be in your mod list and will run when you play the game.
